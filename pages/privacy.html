      <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>We implement industry-standard technical and organisational safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, no system can be absolutely secure and you agree that we cannot guarantee the complete security of your information.</p>
